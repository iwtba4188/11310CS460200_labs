### Write down your regression equation in basic part (1%)
$y=w_0+w_1 \cdot weight+w_2 \cdot weight^2$, where $w_0=0.02648253$, $w_1=0.59029589$ and $w_2=0.00108035$.

### Briefly describe the variables and the regression equation you used in the advanced part (2%)

### Briefly describe the difficulty you encountered (1%)
- **The value of data is too large when degree went high**:

- **The fixed learning rate leads the oscillate of $w$**: 

### Summarize how you solve the difficulty and your reflections (1%)
